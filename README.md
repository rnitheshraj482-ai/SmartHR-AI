# SmartHR-AI
This project introduces an AI-powered HR system with four intelligent agents: one to answer HR policy and leave queries, one to screen and rank resumes, one to conduct and evaluate interviews, and one to assist with employee onboarding. It automates HR tasks, improves hiring efficiency, and enhances employee experience.
